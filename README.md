This repo is a compilation of various subjects using Python, with a focus on areas pertaining to data analytics/data science and machine learning. Here are some of the Python libraries used in this project:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Cufflinks
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- And more...

This repository was built as part of a course offered via Udemy: [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

You can find a breakdown of each major section of this repository below: 

- Data Analysis: This section highlights the use of the **Numpy** and **Pandas** libraries for data cleaning and analysis
- Data Visualization: This is where various visualization libraries are explored, such as **Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks, and Matplotlib**
- Capstone Projects: This section contains two capstone projects for the analysis/visualization portion. One is an analysis of 911 calls, and the other is a deep dive into stock data.
- Machine Learning: Dives into different types of machine learning algorithms, with heavy usage of the **Scikit-learn** library. Models explored in this section include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K Means Clustering
  - Decision Trees & Random Forests
  - Recommender Systems
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - Natural Language Processing (in progress)
 
Sections that are going to be added soon:
- [ ] Neural Nets and Deep Learning
- [ ] Big Data and Spark
